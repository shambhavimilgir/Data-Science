    "### Task 1: Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Build 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import necessary libraries: We will use numpy and scipy.stats for calculations related to mean, standard deviation, and t-distribution.\n",
    "2. Data Preparation: Input the durability data into a numpy array.\n",
    "3. Calculate Sample Statistics:\n",
    "    1. Compute the sample mean(𝑥).\n",
    "    2. Compute the sample standard deviation 𝑠.\n",
    "    3. Determine the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "4. Find the Critical Value (t-score): Use the t-distribution to find the critical value corresponding to a 99% confidence level and 𝑛−1 degrees of freedom.\n",
    "5. Calculate Margin of Error: Compute the margin of error using the formula 𝐸=𝑡∗𝑠/sq.root(𝑛), where 𝑡 is the critical value and 𝑛 is the sample size.\n",
    "6. Construct Confidence Interval: Combine the sample mean and margin of error to form the confidence interval 𝑥±𝐸.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Rationale Behind Using the t-Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The population standard deviation (𝜎) is unknown and estimated from the sample standard deviation (𝑠).\n",
    "2. The sample size 𝑛=15 is relatively small, making the t-distribution appropriate for calculating confidence intervals.\n",
    "3. Using the t-distribution accounts for the uncertainty introduced by using the sample standard deviation instead of the population standard deviation."
